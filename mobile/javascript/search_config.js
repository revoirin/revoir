Known as            Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta, this ser-            mon laid the foundation for the Dharma            (Buddhist teachings), marking the estab-            lishment of the Sangha (community of            monks). Buddhists celebrate this day by            participating in prayer meetings, reciting            Buddhist scriptures, and engaging in            acts of charity.              Jain tradition: In Jainism, Guru Pur-            nima is observed as Treenok Guha Pur-            nima, marking the day when Lord Ma-            havira, the 24th Tirthankara, made            Indrabhuti Gautam his first disciple, es-            tablishing the guru-disciple tradition            within the Jain community.

Importance of brain health              The brain is the most complex organ            in the human body, responsible for con-            trolling every aspect of our lives, from            basic physiological functions to com-            plex cognitive processes. Maintaining            brain health is crucial for overall well-            being. Neurological disorders can signif-            icantly impact an individual's quality of            life, leading to physical, cognitive, and            emotional challenges. Early diagnosis,            effective treatment, and preventive            measures are essential in mitigating the            effects of these conditions.

Here are some key strategies for main-            taining brain health:              Healthy diet: A balanced diet rich in            fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean            proteins, and healthy fats can support            brain health. Certain nutrients, such as            omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and            vitamins, have been shown to have neu-            roprotective properties.              Regular exercise: Physical activity            has numerous benefits for the brain, in-            cluding improving cognitive function,            reducing the risk of neurological dis-            orders, and promoting neuroplasticity.            Aim for at least 150 minutes of mod-            erate-intensity aerobic exercise per            week, along with muscle-strengthening            activities.              Mental stimulation: Engaging in in-            tellectually stimulating activities, such            as reading, puzzles, and learning new            skills, can help keep the brain sharp and            may reduce the risk of cognitive decline.              Adequate sleep: Sleep is essential            for brain health, as it allows the brain to            rest, repair, and consolidate memories.            Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per            night.              Stress management: Chronic stress            can have detrimental effects on the            brain. Practice stress-reducing tech-            niques, such as mindfulness, meditation,            and relaxation exercises, to promote            mental well-being.              Social engagement: Staying socially            active and maintaining strong social            connections can have positive effects on                                                                            brain health.
